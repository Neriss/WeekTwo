				<h5>Beccy Diederichs</h5>
					<p class="title">Yoga (substitute)</p>
					<p>I started practicing yoga almost 20 years ago with Kaila Kukla. Her two-hour flow is influenced by Iyengar, Kundalini, and Tantra yoga practices. In 2000, I completed her eight-month yoga teacher training program and began to teach classes in September 2001. My classes derive from my studies with Kaila and provide a smooth flow of postures, breath, and meditation for beginners to experienced practitioners. I am a visual artist, writer, writing consultant and tutor, and balance my yoga with pick-up ice hockey.</p>
					<p>Namaste, <br>Beccy Diederichs</p>
